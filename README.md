# bat_speed

Bat Speed has been statistically proven to be highly correlated with Exit Velocity and higher levels of performance at the plate. For such an important underlying metric, much is still unknown due to the limitations of publicly available data. Devices such as Blast Motion and Zepp can record Bat Speed, but the data is kept within teams or organizations. However, public analysts have found various ways to reverse engineer Statcast Exit Velocity data to determine Bat Speed. My project serves as a follow up to this research and focuses on how Bat Speed interacts with age. Using the Delta Method, I created aging curves to understand how Bat Speed changes over a player’s career. I found Bat Speed plateaus in the late 20s and did not begin to decline until after turning 30, which is a later decline than other performance metrics such as WAR and wRC+. I also find that height plays a role in the decline as shorter players reach peak Bat Speed early in their careers, but decline more steadily than taller batters. Finally, subsetting by player’s Bat Speed upon entering the MLB, I find evidence that players lacking in Bat Speed do improve with age. This was an interesting find from a player development as well as a scouting perspective, as Bat Speed is an area of a player’s game that can be improved and or projected.
